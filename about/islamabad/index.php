          <p>Located at the foot of the Margalla hills, the capital city of Pakistan ‘Islamabad’ was constructed during the 1960’s to
            house the country’s major governing bodies. Now, half a decade later, Islamabad is a picturesque city comprising of a population
            of 2 million along with its neighbouring city Rawalpindi. It has also been the home of NIMUN since its inception and has hosted
            both national and international delegates every year.

            <br><br>Islamabad is a famous tourist location owing to the city’s location and scenic beauty. The Pakistan Monument rests atop the
            Shakarparian hills and represents Pakistan’s four provinces and three territories as four main petals of the monument represent the
            four provinces and the three smaller petals represent the territories. Pakistan’s culture and heritage has been represented on the
            petals in the form of beautiful carvings. The administrative backbone of the country, including the Presidency, Supreme Court, PM
            House and Pakistan Secretariat, are located along Constitution Avenue.

            <br><br>The Faisal Mosque, with a backdrop of the Margalla Hills, stands tall as the largest mosque of Pakistan and is an iconic
            symbol of the country around the world. The mosque can be seen from miles away due to its central location. Designed by a Turkish
            architect and financed by the late King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia, the mosque is unlike any other traditional mosques
            in Pakistan and covers an area of 54,000 square feet. Accommodating around 240,000 worshippers, it is also a famous tourist
            location.

          <p>Daman-e-Koh, located on the Margalla hills provides an expansive view of the city and is a famous destination for both the
            residents of the city and tourists. Surrounded by the lush green Margalla hills, the road to Daman-e-Koh is a treat in itself.
            Several hiking trails have been developed among the hills and are a popular excursion point for tourists and residents.

            <br><br>A compact city, Islamabad can be described as being elegantly urban with small coffee shops and food joints co-existing
            peacefully with residential areas. Super and Jinnah Super markets are the oldest shopping locations in the area which provide
            everything from food to clothing. The Centaurus is the city’s main shopping mall fulfilling all retail needs of the city’s
            residents.

            <br><br>The Saidpur Village, located east of Daman-e-Koh is more than 500 years old. A section of the village has been converted into
            a tourist attraction that provides a scenic view of the Margallas and several dining options that serve all types of traditional
            Pakistani foods.

            <br><br>Perhaps Islamabad’s best offering is the Monal Restaurant located in Pir Sohawa on top of the Margalla Hills. At more than
            3000 feet above sea level, Pir Sohawa is Islamabad’s highest spot and is a famous destination for visitors and residents both.
            The Monal Restaurant provides an exceptional dining experience due to the view the restaurant provides and the palatable authentic
            Pakistani cuisine made by its chefs.

            <br><br>Islamabad may be a young city, but in its short history, has managed to encompass and showcase the delicate mix of all that
            is Pakistan in all its glory.
