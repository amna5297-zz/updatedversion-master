          <p>The so-called twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi are commonly viewed as one unit, and indeed, one day the two will
              physically merge. However, these twins, with separate ancestry and distinct personalities, are far from identical.
              Islamabad is a late-20th-century capital laid out in straight lines and right angles: a proud metric showcase of government
              and administration. Rawalpindi, on the other hand, grew from a ramshackle backwater village to a sprawling hub on the Grand
              Trunk Rd during the 19th century.
              <br>The twins’ personalities are rather like chalk and cheese: Islamabad is patently more subdued and suburban with broad
              avenues, grassy parkland, shiny restaurants and just a whiff of the exasperating human and mechanical crush that
              epitomises most subcontinental cities. For those with a penchant for the adrenaline-pumping hullabaloo that a typical
              South Asian metropolis delivers, all that awaits in Rawalpindi – affectionately dubbed ‘Pindi’ – a mere 15km away.
              <br>Nestled in the heart of Pakistan, the Federal Capital of Pakistan – Islamabad, namely – has been the centre of talk
              and domestic tourism for over many years. Starting off as an expedition of General Ayub Khan, the city was brought to life,
              and over the course of its existence, it has grown to become one of the most beautiful capital cities of Asia – no doubt, it
              doesn’t hold back in the global comparison, but we’ll stick to what we know.

          <p>Whether it’s the fresh air and the liveliness of the place, or whether you’re a fan of amazing food, served by spectacular
            cuisines with beautiful views such as the Monal Restaurant or famous Chaaye Tea houses like Chaayé Khana, , or any other franchise
            you spotted in some other city; whether it’s the crowd at the amazing Centaurus Mall that takes you by surprise, or whether it’s the
            system that gives you a sense of peace, Islamabad has it all!

            <br>But it’s not just the eateries and the liveliness that makes Islamabad a popular tourist destination. The serenity of the city
            as a whole is what defines the Federal Capital. The city is nestled in the heart of the beautiful mountains of the Pakistan, and
            Islamabad is basically the ‘transit’ city when you’re travelling to the beautiful Northern mountainous areas. It’s a beautiful
            morning every day, and it’s a beautiful city to live in. In all, it’s the beauty of the place that takes you out every day for a
            stroll.

            <br>Enter Islamabad, and you’ll discover the amazing Education City of NUST at the start. This 707-acre University has been the
            proud maker of dreams for thousands of students currently enrolled at NUST. The quality of education and the vast opportunities
            that it provides makes NUST a dream university for many to study at, which is the only Pakistani university to be ranked amongst
            top 100 on the QS University Ranking, worldwide.

            <br>Witness it all, this January, at the NUST International Model United Nations conference 2016!
